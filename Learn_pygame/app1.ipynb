    "The programs we write with Python functions can only work with texts received and printed with print and input functions. Your program can display various texts and the user can also write the desired text with the keyboard. Such programs have command line interface or CLI (command line interface). These programs are somewhat limited because they cannot draw different shapes, have colors or use the mouse. CLI programs can only receive input with the input function. After the program receives the input, the user must press Enter so that the program can receive the next input. From these statements, it can be concluded that it is impossible to make real-time reactive games with CLI."
